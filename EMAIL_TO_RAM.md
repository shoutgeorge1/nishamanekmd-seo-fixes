Subject: Technical SEO Fixes for nishamanekmd.com - Implementation Package

Hey Ram,

Hope you're doing well! I had some free time today and decided to run a technical SEO audit on nishamanekmd.com. Found some critical issues that are hurting their search visibility.

## Quick Context:
When it comes to SEO, there are three main areas:
1. **Technical SEO** (what I focused on today)
2. **On-page SEO** (content optimization)
3. **Backlinks** (link building)

This is just the **technical SEO** side - the foundation that needs to be solid before anything else matters. There may be other issues, but this is the first run.

## What I Did:
- Ran it through ChatGPT and Claude for analysis
- Did a couple crawls with Screaming Frog
- Downloaded the most important issues
- Uploaded everything to Cursor and had it do most of the work
- Created a complete implementation package

## Critical Issues Found:
1. **Homepage build error** - Portable Text checkbox error visible to users
2. **Missing robots.txt** - 404 error blocking search engines
3. **Missing XML sitemap** - Google can't discover pages efficiently
4. **Missing structured data** - No rich snippets in search results

## Implementation Package:
**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/shoutgeorge1/nishamanekmd-seo-fixes

## For Your Team:
1. Go to the GitHub link above
2. Click "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP" 
3. Read `PRIORITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for what to do first
4. Follow `DEVELOPER_TASK_LIST.md` for specific tasks
5. Implement the critical fixes first (2 hours total)

**All code is ready to copy/paste. The fixes will resolve the search engine issues immediately.**

## What's Included:
- **Critical technical fixes** (2 hours) - Fixes immediate problems
- **Complete SEO package** (additional 4-6 hours) - Full optimization
- **Step-by-step instructions** - Easy for your team to follow
- **Production-ready code** - No guessing what to implement

## Expected Results:
- **24 hours:** Homepage error gone, robots.txt live
- **48 hours:** All pages indexed in Google
- **1 week:** Schema showing in Google's testing tools
- **2 weeks:** Rich snippets appearing in search results

## Support:
I'm not working today (that's why I did this - kind of a fun project), but there's still a lot of work to do. I can help if you need clarification on any of the implementations.

**This is just the technical foundation - once this is solid, we can tackle the content and link building aspects.**

Let me know if you have any questions or if your team needs help with any of the implementations.

Best,
George
