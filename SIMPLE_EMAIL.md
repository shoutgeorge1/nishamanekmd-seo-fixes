Subject: Critical SEO Fixes for nishamanekmd.com

Hi [Developer Name],

I found 4 critical technical issues on nishamanekmd.com that are hurting search engine visibility. I've created a complete implementation package with all the code needed to fix them.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/shoutgeorge1/nishamanekmd-seo-fixes

## Critical Issues (Fix These First):
1. **Homepage build error** - Portable Text checkbox error visible to users
2. **Missing robots.txt** - 404 error blocking search engines
3. **Missing XML sitemap** - Google can't discover pages efficiently
4. **Missing structured data** - No rich snippets in search results

## What to do:
1. Go to the GitHub link above
2. Click "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP" 
3. Read `PRIORITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for what to do first
4. Follow `DEVELOPER_TASK_LIST.md` for specific tasks
5. Implement the critical fixes first (2 hours total)

**All code is ready to copy/paste. The fixes will resolve the search engine issues immediately.**

Let me know if you need help with any of the implementations.
